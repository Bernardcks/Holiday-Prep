This is my preparation to learn about full-stack development during the holidays

Notable:

Always keep Dev console on (F12)

Use 'debugger' keyword to step debug

Download 'React developer tools' chrome extension

Values updated are asynchronous

Event handlers DO NOT use function calls(use '() =>' for quick fix); They take in the whole function instead

Hooks rules: Top level of function component, Same order every render, NOT inside conditionals, loops or nested functions

Function that returns a function(WHY??): pass arguments to event handler, generate handlers dynamically, create closures
